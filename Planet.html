            <p class="gal_1 container"> A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxia, literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (10<sup>8</sup>) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. 
            <br> <br>
            The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within.The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of 150-200,000 light-years, an increase from traditional estimates of 100,000 light-years. Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter disk, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years.
            <br> <br>
            Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approx 220 km per second. The constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much (about 90%) of the mass of the Milky Way is invisible to telescopes, neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation. This conjectural mass has been termed "dark matter". The rotational period is about 240 million years the radius of the Sun. The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approx 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.

Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. </p>
